Local Farm Products Website
This website is designed to connect farmers and local consumers, making it easier for them to buy and sell local farm products. It's built using the MERN stack and uses various features to make the buying and selling experience easy and seamless.

Features
QR Code Scanning: We have implemented QR code scanning for order tracking. This helps users to track their orders easily and quickly.

Reduced Carbon Footprints: Our website shows the delivery boy the distance between the pickup and drop location. This helps in reducing carbon footprints by selecting the shortest and most efficient route.

Tech Stack
MERN Stack: We have used the MERN stack to build this website. MERN stack stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. It is a popular web development stack and is widely used in developing modern web applications.
Installation
